    \section{Summary}
    I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in \Textbf{Cybersecurity} at the University of Salerno.
    I received my Bachelor's degree in \textbf{Computer Science} in 2022.
    My expertise lies in Cybersecurity, gained through both my academic studies and hands-on experience, including competing at the national level in \href{https://cyberchallenge.it/}{CyberChallengeIT 2024}, where I represented the University of Salerno. Additionally, I have gained practical knowledge through some experiences with my CTF team (\href{https://bytethecookies.github.io/}{ByteTheCookies}) in organizing and participating in CTF competitions. Beyond academia, I have developed strong competencies in blockchain technology, which I have learned independently, and I am passionate about its potential for enhancing security and privacy. I also had the opportunity to delve deeper into \textbf{Blockchain Security} and \textbf{Zero-Knowledge Proofs} for my master's thesis.
